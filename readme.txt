!!!!!!Notifiaction Bot!!!!!!!

This is simple python script which when executed sends a notification to the user
-about the contest details in codechef and codeforces.
This python script uses BeautifulSoup(for web scraping) and SMTP package to send the 
-email notification to the User.

The script can be used by scheduling it in a server(if you can setup one or have one)
or else you can just use a raspberry pi and schedule the python script so that the script 
executes daily at a particular time.
